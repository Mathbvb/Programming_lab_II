## About this project

This is a program of a car rental company. The project is based in simple linked lists and is divided in 5 archives:
- time (made by the teacher, not my code);
- cars; 
- clients;
- rental;
- control.

Control has the menus and controls the actions of the user and is used to show some reports;

Cars and clients have functions to create and control the lists and some other auxiliary functions that are used principaly at the rental;

Rental has the list to allow clients to rent a car, it'll receive in its list the pointer to the client and the car and also do some other auxiliary functions, the function that calculates the amount of the rental puts the price at the month in which the client returns the car.
