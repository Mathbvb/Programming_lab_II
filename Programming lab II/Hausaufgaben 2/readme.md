## About this project

This is a program that dynamic allocates a matrix of the size informed by the user. The user fill the matrix with chars (the program assumes that the user will not write more elements than what the matrix can allocate), and at last the user can search for a word in the matrix and it'll print where that word is in any direction at the matrix (only print the first occurence in a direction).
